Little helpful tools and scripts that employ Boto - the Python interface to Amazon Web Services

Installation
-------------
You'll need to have boto installed and in your local python's module path.
```pip install boto```

or pull down the utility from github - https://github.com/boto/boto

Usage:
-------------
Simply call the command line tools.  You'll need to have your AWS access and secret keys in either the boto config, your environment variables, or handy to pass as flags.
See each individual tool for usage details.


To do:
-------------

Tugboto is eventually going to be a shell.

- Tugboto needs a CLI module that calls separate modules
- The code needs a serious cleanup
